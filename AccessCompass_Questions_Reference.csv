Before Arrival,B1,Pre-visit information,B1-D-1c,Deep Dive,medium,Is this information written primarily for customers or for compliance?,"Customer-focused information helps people make decisions and plan visits. Compliance-focused information often uses technical language and may not answer the questions customers actually have.

The most useful accessibility information does both: it meets obligations while genuinely helping people understand what to expect.","Primarily for customers | Primarily for compliance | A mix of both | Not sure",B1-F-1 = Yes OR Partially
Before Arrival,B1,Pre-visit information,B1-D-2a,Deep Dive,high,Does your physical access information include specific details that help customers plan?,"Select all that apply.

Before Arrival,B1,Pre-visit information,B1-D-7b,Deep Dive,medium,How are familiarisation visits communicated to customers?,"If you offer familiarisation visits, consider how customers would know this is available.

Is it mentioned on your website, in booking communications, or when customers enquire about accessibility? Is the process documented anywhere for staff reference?

Visibility matters. An excellent offer has limited value if customers don't know it exists.","Mentioned on website | Included in booking communications | Offered when customers enquire | Staff know to offer when relevant | Not actively communicated | Other",B1-F-7 = Yes OR On request
Before Arrival,B1,Pre-visit information,B1-D-8a,Deep Dive,medium,Is your transport information specific to accessibility needs?,"Generic directions are less useful than accessibility-specific guidance.

Before Arrival,B4.1,Website basics,B4.1-1-2,Pulse Check,high,Do all images on your website have alt text or image descriptions?,"Alt text and image descriptions both help people understand images, but they are used in slightly different ways.

Alt text is a short description added directly to an image. It is read automatically by screen readers and should briefly explain the purpose of the image in context.

Image descriptions are longer explanations provided in nearby text or linked content. They are useful for complex images such as charts, diagrams, maps, or detailed visuals that need more explanation than a short alt text allows.","Yes | Some images | No | Not sure",
Before Arrival,B4.1,Website basics,B4.1-1-3,Pulse Check,high,Is your website text easy to read with good contrast between text and background?,"Good colour contrast makes text easier to read. Text should clearly stand out from the background, for example dark text on a light background, or light text on a dark background. Text that blends into the background, uses very light colours, or sits on busy images can be hard to read.

If you need to strain your eyes, zoom in, or adjust your screen to read the text comfortably, or if you cannot easily scan the page, the contrast may not be strong enough.","Yes | Mostly | No | Not sure",
Before Arrival,B4.1,Website basics,B4.1-1-4,Pulse Check,medium,Can users resize text up to 400% without losing content or functionality?,"Text resizing allows users to increase the size of text without breaking the page.

Before Arrival,B4.3,Video and social media,B4.3-1-2,Pulse Check,medium,Do you include alt text and image descriptions when posting on social media?,"Alt text and image descriptions both help people understand images, but they are used in slightly different ways.

Alt text is a short description added directly to an image. It is read automatically by screen readers and should briefly explain the purpose of the image in context.

Image descriptions are longer explanations provided in nearby text or linked content. They are useful for complex images such as charts, diagrams, maps, or detailed visuals that need more explanation than a short alt text allows.","Yes - always | Sometimes | No | We don't use social media | Not sure",
Before Arrival,B4.3,Video and social media,B4.3-1-3,Pulse Check,medium,"Are video controls accessible (play, pause, volume)?","Accessible video controls allow users to easily play, pause, stop, and adjust the volume of a video.
