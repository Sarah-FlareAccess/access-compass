Question ID,Module Name,Journey Phase,Review Depth,Question Text (Exact),Response Options,Helper Text,Conditional Logic
has_physical_location,Context,N/A,Foundation,Does your business have a physical location that customers visit?,Yes / No,(none),If No → hide A* physical space modules (arrival/entry/paths/seating/toilets/sensory/signage/safety)

B4.1-1-2,Website basics,Before arrival,Foundation,Do all images on your website have alt text or image descriptions?,Yes / No / Not sure,"Alt text and image descriptions both help people understand images, but they are used in slightly different ways.

Alt text is a short description added directly to an image. It is read automatically by screen readers and should briefly explain the purpose of the image in context.

Image descriptions are longer explanations provided in nearby text or linked content. They are useful for complex images such as charts, diagrams, maps, or detailed visuals that need more explanation than a short alt text can provide.

Both alt text and image descriptions should focus on what the image is communicating, not just what it looks like. This applies across your website and any embedded content where images are used to communicate information.

Decorative images that do not add information do not need alt text or image descriptions. ",None
B4.1-1-3,Website basics,Before arrival,Foundation,Is your website text easy to read with good contrast between text and background?,Yes / No / Not sure,"Good colour contrast makes text easier to read.

B4.1-1-4,Website basics,Before arrival,Foundation,Can users resize text up to 400% without losing content or functionality?,Yes / No / Not sure,"Text resizing allows users to increase the size of text without breaking the page. When text is increased, content should remain visible and usable. Text should not overlap, disappear, be cut off, or require sideways scrolling to read. Buttons, menus, and forms should still work as expected.

You can usually test this by zooming your browser or increasing text size and checking whether the page still works smoothly.",None
B4.1-1-5,Website basics,Before arrival,Foundation,Does your website work well on mobile devices?,Yes / No / Not sure,"A website that works well on mobile is easy to use on a phone or tablet, not just on a desktop computer.

On mobile devices, text should be readable without zooming, buttons and links should be easy to tap, and content should fit the screen without needing to scroll sideways. Menus, forms, and key features should still work smoothly.

You can check this by opening your website on a phone and trying to complete common tasks, such as finding information, using the menu, or submitting a form.",None

B4.2-1-1,Booking systems and forms,Before arrival,Foundation,Can customers share their accessibility requirements when booking online?,Yes / No / Not sure,"This refers to whether customers have a clear way to tell you about their accessibility needs during the online booking process.

It should be easy to find, optional to complete, and reviewed by staff so requests can be acknowledged and responded to.",None

B4.3-1-1,Video and social media,Before arrival,Foundation,Do your videos have captions or subtitles?,Yes / No / Not sure,"Captions or subtitles display spoken words and important sounds from a video as text on the screen. 
Captions are especially important for videos that share information, instructions, or stories.

Captions should be accurate, easy to read, and available for all spoken content, not just key moments.",None
B4.3-1-2,Video and social media,Before arrival,Foundation,Do you include alt text and image descriptions when posting on social media?,Yes / No / Not sure,"Alt text and image descriptions both help people understand images, but they are used in slightly different ways.

Alt text is a short description added directly to an image. It is read automatically by screen readers and should briefly explain the purpose of the image in context.

Image descriptions are longer explanations provided in nearby text or linked content. They are useful for complex images such as charts, diagrams, maps, or detailed visuals that need more explanation than a short alt text can provide.

Decorative images that do not add information do not need alt text or image descriptions. ",None
B4.3-1-3,Video and social media,Before arrival,Foundation,"Are video controls accessible (play, pause, volume)?",Yes / No / Not sure,"Accessible video controls allow users to easily play, pause, stop, and adjust the volume of a video.

If a video plays automatically, users should be able to quickly pause or stop it. Controls should be easy to find, clearly labelled, and usable with a keyboard, mouse, or touch. ",None
