# Australian Standards Reference for Access Compass

## Legislative Framework

### Disability (Access to Premises - Buildings) Standards 2010 (as amended 2024)
- The **Premises Standards** are the legislative instrument that makes certain accessibility requirements mandatory
- The 2024 Amendment (Measures No. 1) now references **AS 1428.1:2021** instead of AS 1428.1:2009
- Only requirements referenced in the Premises Standards are legally mandatory ("deemed to satisfy" provisions)
- The Premises Standards work in conjunction with the **National Construction Code (NCC)** / Building Code of Australia (BCA)
- Requirements apply to new buildings and buildings undergoing upgrades that require building approval

### Key Standards Referenced

| Standard | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| AS 1428.1:2021 | Design for access and mobility - General requirements for access - New building work | **Mandatory** (via Premises Standards) |
| AS 1428.2:1992 (R2015) | Design for access and mobility - Enhanced and additional requirements - Buildings and facilities | **Best practice** (enhanced beyond mandatory minimum) |
| AS 1428.4 | Tactile ground surface indicators | Mandatory (referenced in Premises Standards) |
| AS 1428.5:2010 | Communication for people who are deaf or hearing impaired | Best practice / partially mandatory |
| AS 1735.12 | Lifts - Facilities for persons with disabilities | Mandatory (via Premises Standards) |
| AS 2890.6 | Off-street parking for people with disabilities | Mandatory (via Premises Standards) |

### Important Notes
- AS 1428.2 covers 90% of users (vs 80% for AS 1428.1) - it provides ENHANCED requirements
- Compliance with AS 1428.2 automatically means compliance with AS 1428.1
- Not all elements in these standards are mandatory - depends on what the Premises Standards call up
- Existing buildings generally only need to comply when undergoing significant renovation requiring building approval
