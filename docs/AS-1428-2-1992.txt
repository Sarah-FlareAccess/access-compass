PR E FA CE

This Standard was prepared by the Standards Australia Committee on Access for People with Disabilities to supersede AS 1428, Supplement 1--1988 Extracts--Design rules for access by the disabled (Supplement to AS 1428--1977).

The purpose of this Standard is twofold. First, it covers items which are not covered in AS 1428.1, Design for access and mobility, Part 1: General requirements for access--Buildings , and second it gives enhanced requirements for access, for reference by authorities and other users who wish to provide a greater level of accessibility than the minimum requirements of Part 1.

Whereas the requirements in Part 1 are based on research on the capabilities of 80 percent of people with disabilities in Australia who use wheelchairs, together with some recognized needs of other disability groups, the enhanced requirements in this Standard have been determined, where possible, from the researched capabilities of at least 90 percent of test subjects comprising both people who use wheelchairs and ambulant people. Where the minimum space, dimensions and gradients of Part 1 have been shown to be suitable for 90 percent of users, the requirements of AS 1428.1 have been called up in this Standard.

The major sources for determining the requirements in this Standard are studies by J. Bails, Public Buildings Department of South Australia, 1983, and E. Steinfeld, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA, 1979. For reach limits, reference was also made to A study of the space requirements of wheelchair users from the official journal of the International Society of Paraplegia: Paraplegia, volume 4, Number 1, May 1966. In recommending spaces between rest areas and time allowance at traffic lights, reference was made to the ability of people to move stated distances and the movement time of people in the 1990 research report An ergonomic study of pedestrian areas for disabled people, Institute of Transport Studies, University of Leeds, UK.

The series, when complete, will comprise the following:

AS 1428 1428.1 1428.2 1428.3 1428.4

Design for access and mobility General requirements for access--Buildings Enhanced and additional requirements--Buildings and facilities (this Standard) Requirements for children and adolescents with physical disabilities Tactile ground surface indicators for the orientation of people with vision impairment

* For further information on the heights of letters for different situations, reference should be made to AS 1744.

NOTE: Helvetica Medium typeface is preferred.

17.3 Illumination of signs Illumination of signs shall be provided in accordance with Clause 19 for general displays. Lighting shall be placed so that unwanted reflections shall not occur on the sign.
The luminance factor of the surface of numbers, letters or symbols shall be not less than 0.3 (30 percent) different from their background.
17.4 Location of signs Signs including symbols, numbering and lettering shall be located as follows:
(a) Where they are clearly visible to people in both a seated and standing position (see Clause 25).
NOTES: 1 Signs should be placed within a zone at a height not less than 1400 mm and not more than 1600 mm above the plane of the finished floor.
Where space in this zone is used up, the zone for placement of signs may be extended downward to not less than 1000 mm from the plane of the finished floor. This height assists people to read from either a seated or a standing position, and also assists people with low vision to read the information on the sign. Letters and symbols in relief assist people with severe visual disabilities. 2 Where a sign can be temporarily obscured, e.g. in a crowd, the sign should be placed at a height of not less than 2000 mm above the plane of the finished floor.
(b) At changes of direction.
(c) At sites where directional decisions are made, to enable the appropriate decisions to be made before a change of direction occurs.
(d) Where the surface of the wall surrounding the sign provides sufficient contrast to the sign. If this surface provides insufficient contrast (e.g. patterned wallpapers), the background to the sign shall be increased in size.
NOTES: 1 The message that the sign carries should be unambiguous. 2 Tactile floor plans or maps and prerecorded auditory instructions at the main entrance and at other useful locations can be of assistance to
people with visual impairment.
18 WARNINGS
NOTE: Colour and textural changes on floor surfaces placed where there is a break in plane, at the junction of a stair tread and riser, or where a ramped surface meets a level surface provide clues to changed conditions for people with vision impairment.
18.1 Tactile ground surface indicators Tactile ground surface indicators (see Preface) shall be provided at the following locations:
(a) Stairways, escalators and ramps. (b) Kerb ramps and step ramps. (c) Pedestrian crossings at roadways. (d) Pedestrian crossings in high-use vehicular areas, e.g. car parks. (e) Vehicle pick-up and drop-off areas. (f) Railway platforms. (g) Passenger wharves. (h) Where there is a hazard within a circulation space or adjacent to a path of travel.
NOTES: 1 As tactile ground surface indicators would normally indicate a hazard at ground level, hazards within circulation spaces should be protected
by a suitable barrier.
2 Clause 6.7(a) requires a minimum clearance of 2 m above accessible paths of travel.
(i) Where indication of a change of direction is required.
NOTE: For warning strip on nosing of steps, see Clause 13.3.

18.2 Emergency warning systems

18.2.1 General Emergency warning systems shall include both audible alarms complying with Clause 18.2.2 and visual alarms complying with Clause 18.2.3.

NOTE: This applies to emergency evacuation signals, traffic signals and audible alarms for safety.
18.2.2 Audible alarms Audible emergency alarms shall produce audible signals in accordance with the requirements for output of loudspeakers in AS 2200.2, except that levels shall exceed by 15 dB(A) the noisiest background sound pressure level averaged over a period of 60 s, and the level shall not be less than 75 dB(A).

NOTE: It is essential that audible emergency signals have an intensity and frequency that can attract the attention of individuals who have partial hearing loss. People over 60 years of age generally have difficulty in perceiving frequencies higher than 6000 Hz.

18.2.3 Visual alarms Visual alarms in accordance with AS 2220.1 shall be arranged to flash in conjunction with the audible emergency alarms. The flashing frequency of visual alarms shall be approximately 1 Hz.

NOTES: 1 Specialized systems using advanced technology may be substituted if equivalent protection is provided. 2 The specifications in this Section do not preclude the use of zoned or coded alarm systems.

18.2.4 Auxiliary alarms Auxiliary alarms provided for people with hearing impairments shall be connected to the building emergency system or there shall be a standard electrical socket into which an alarm unit can be connected to be activated by the building alarm system. Instructions for use of the auxiliary alarm or connections shall be provided.

NOTE: In sleeping accommodation and in all rooms where people with hearing impairment may work or reside, care should be taken to locate the auxiliary emergency alarms to ensure that they will be effective when warning of emergencies. To be effective, visual auxiliary alarms should be located and oriented so that they will spread signals and reflections throughout a space or raise the overall light level sharply. The amount and type of light necessary to wake a deaf person from a sound sleep in a dark room will vary depending on a number of factors, including the size and configuration of the room, the distance between the source and the person, whether the light flashes, and, if so, the cycle of flashing. A 150-watt flashing bulb can be effective under some conditions. Some devices are designed specifically as visual alarms for deaf people.
Deaf people may not need accessibility features other than the emergency alarm connections and communications devices. Thus, in addition to
those accessible for wheelchair users, rooms should also be equipped with emergency visual alarms or connections.
18.2.5 Installed personal alarm systems Alarm systems for personal use shall comply with AS 2999.

18.3 Signs warning of danger Danger and caution signs shall be placed sufficiently ahead of a particular hazard to allow sufficient time to take notice of the warning.

NOTES:
1 This distance will vary, e.g. signs warning against touching switches and other electrical equipment should be placed close to the equipment, whereas signs used in plant yards or on construction work should be placed a suitable distance from the danger zone.
2 Where audible signals are not considered necessary, the most satisfactory warning is the provision of changes in both texture and colour to provide a luminance contrast with the background of not less than 0.3 (30 percent).

18.4 Barricades, hoardings and safety rails Barricades, hoardings and safety rails in pedestrian areas shall be rigid, distinctively coloured and, if no toe rail or similarly effective device is provided, they shall be placed to provide not less than 1 m clearance from the obstruction.

18.5 Warnings on doors to hazardous areas Doors that lead to areas that might prove dangerous to a person with a visual impairment (e.g. doors to loading platforms, boiler rooms, stages, and the like) shall be made identifiable to the touch by a textured surface on the door handle, knob, pull, or other door-operating hardware. This textured surface may be made by knurling or roughening, or by a material applied to the contact surface. Such textured surfaces shall not be provided for emergency exit doors or any doors other than those to hazardous areas.
19 LIGHTING

19.1 Illumination levels Illumination levels shall be uniform and comply with the requirements for maintenance illumination set out in AS 1680.2.

NOTES:

1 The following minimum levels of maintenance illumination are recommended:

Entrances Passageways and walkway Stairs Ramps Lifts Toilet and locker rooms Counter tops General displays Telephones

s150 lx 150 lx 150 lx See AS 1735.12 200 lx 250 lx 200-300 lx 200 lx

2 Many people require better artificial lighting than is normally provided. This applies particularly to older people and to all people with impaired sight.

3 For people with impaired hearing, a level of illumination of not less than 150 lx, without glare, is needed to allow for lip reading.

AS 1428.2--1992

19.2 Light switches Switches shall be in accordance with Clause 22.4. In bedrooms, at least one room light of not less than 150 lx shall have a bedside switch.
NOTES: 1 Overhead lighting is preferred. 2 The provision of night lights in circulation areas and bathrooms is beneficial. 3 The provision of two-way switches is desirable.

20 SOUND LEVELS
NOTE: It is essential to effective hearing that the recommended design sound levels for various functional areas of buildings given in AS 2107 be adhered to. Care should be taken to comply with these recommendations in the installation of air-conditioners, computer machinery and the like.
21 HEARING AUGMENTATION ­ LISTENING SYSTEMS
21.1 General Where a sound amplification system is provided, a listening system to aid hearing-impaired people shall be installed or made available and shall cover at least 10 percent of the total area of the enclosed space. A sign indicating that an assistive hearing device is installed or is available shall be provided in accordance with Clauses 16 and 17 at the main door or doors to the enclosed space. Where the listening system does not cover the total area of the enclosed space, the boundaries of the area served shall be designated by such signs.
NOTE: It is recommended that 10 percent of each classification of seating within an auditorium be provided with a listening system.
21.2 Acceptable types of listening systems Acceptable types of listening systems are as follows:
(a) Audio-frequency induction loop system The audio-frequency induction loop system can be directly received by people using hearing aids fitted with a magnetic induction coil, which is a standard hearing aid option. The recommended magnetic field strength, as specified in AS 1088.4, is -20 ±3 dB relative to 1 ampere per metre for an input signal of level equal to the long-time average level of input speech. This field was chosen so that it is high enough to produce an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio over environmental electromagnetic noise for power installation and the like, yet not so high as to cause overloading of hearing aids.
The audio-frequency induction loop system cannot be used successfully in multiple installations close together, e.g. in adjacent rooms, owing to mutual interference resulting from spillover of the magnetic field outside the looped area, both vertically and horizontally.
(b) Infrared light transmission system In this system, a modulated light beam is transmitted to special receivers worn by the listeners. The line of sight from transmitter to receivers must be unobstructed. The system may become inoperative when the receivers are exposed to direct sunlight.
It may be used as an alternative to the audio-frequency induction loop system when multiple room installations are required to operate simultaneously.
(c) Induction field radio system The induction field radio system is a frequency-modulated system normally operated on a carrier frequency of 3175 kHz allocated by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). This allocation is shared by other radio services, which may occasionally interfere.
The basic feature of the induction field radio hearing aid system is its localized wireless transmission in which the induction field is strong near the transmitter but rapidly becomes weaker with increasing distance; a low power battery-operated version is limited to a range of about 12 metres. When several systems are in use in a confined area, the receiver responds only to the strongest signal.
This system is particularly useful when the speaker, wearing a portable transmitter and associated microphone, must move about in company with the listeners, for example on guided tours in museums and art galleries.
(d) The VHF frequency-modulated radio system Unlike the induction field radio system this system operates in the very high frequency (VHF) band, where a number of channels for use by hearing impaired people have been allocated by the ITU. It can therefore make use of different channels to avoid mutual interference when a number of transmitters have to be used in one building.
Because of the short wavelength used, the received field strength reduces slowly as the distance from the transmitter increases. Potentially it has greater range than the induction field radio system. The system needs an external antenna which is short enough to be carried on the person. On the other hand, induction field radio systems use loop antennae mounted internally in the receiver.
21.3 Considerations when choosing an assistive listening system When choosing a listening system the following considerations apply:
(a) The system needs to be usable by people who do not have hearing aids and by people who ­
(i) have hearing aids with a `T' switch; (ii) have hearing aids with audio input; and (iii) have hearing aids without a `T' switch or audio input.
(b) The frequency response and the adjustable volume gain of the receivers needs to be suitable for people with varying severity of hearing impairment.

AS 1428.2--1992

30

(c) It is essential that the equipment is safe and easy to manipulate and that the hygiene of reusable earpieces on receivers can be ensured.
(d) The system chosen needs to be suitable for the intended use and not be subject to interference from, or cause interference to, any other equipment. For example, audio-loops may be subject to interference from nearby electrical installations; radio-frequency transmissions may interfere with other transmissions on similar bands; strong lighting may interfere with infrared transmission.
(e) It is essential that the system does not interfere with the listening enjoyment of others, e.g. sound leakage from headphones may upset people seated nearby.
(f) Where privacy is required, as in courtroom proceedings, infrared transmission will not pass through walls.

22.3 Reach of ambulant people with disabilities The points at which comfortable reach is achieved by most ambulant people with disabilities are shown in Figure 22.
22.4 Zone of common reach The zone for reach to objects which will be suitable for both ambulant people with disabilities and wheelchair users is shown in Figure 23.
NOTE: The zone of common reach includes those dimensions for shelves, fittings, kitchen and laundry equipment, and items such as vending machines and street furniture, that permit ease of reach for both people who are standing and people who are sitting.
The zone is obtained by using the maximum reach sideways to a shelf for people sitting in a wheelchair and the lowest reach for people who are standing, and may have stiff hips and knees or balance problems.
The intention is that all critical controls, areas of operation and storage of equipment commonly used by most members of the community and people in a household will be placed within this zone of common reach.

APPENDIX A
KITCHENS AND LAUNDRIES
(Informative)
A1 SCOPE This Appendix gives recommendations for the dimensioning, layout and arrangement of kitchens and laundries so that they will be usable by people with disabilities.
A2 GENERAL COMMENTS Kitchens and laundries should be planned economically, without an unnecessarily large circulation area. The design should be one which conserves the user's energy through the interrelationship of facilities.
There is no typical kitchen or typical laundry for people with disabilities. Each has to be specially designed for the user, and the designer will have to assess the user's particular needs before any suggestions can be made.
The best person to consult is the consumer with a disability. An occupational therapist who has been to the person's home and is familiar with his or her needs can offer useful advice.
A3 STORAGE Shelves and cupboards should be installed in accordance with Clause 24.2.
Drawers or slide-out wire baskets are preferred, rather than large open cupboards.
Rotating shelves, which have a lip of not less than 50 mm, are preferred for corners.
Mobile storage units provide an efficient and practical method of storage in the kitchen. Mobile storage units can be kept in knee spaces below the preparation benches. The units can be moved to give more preparation space yet allow positioning close to meal preparation areas where utensils can be accessed easily.
Corners of benches should be rounded to reduce the risk of injury.
Toe recesses should be provided along the front of all benches.
The height and shape of cupboard and drawer handles should comply with Clauses 22 and 23.
Sliding doors should be fitted with stops so that the door stops a minimum distance of 50 mm from the door handle (see Figure A1(a)).
A4 WORK LEVELS ­ PREPARATION CENTRE Work surfaces should be at a consistent level and have an uninterrupted flow. The user is then able to slide goods along the surfaces.
A clear `set-down' space next to oven cooktop, refrigerator and dishwasher should be provided on the bench top.
Where it is necessary to slide hot utensils along work surfaces, the surface material should be heat-resistant.
Bench surfaces should be smooth for easy cleaning and of a non-glare finish.
For vision-impaired users, horizontal surfaces should be a lighter colour than that of the vertical surfaces. The luminance factor of the vertical surface should be not less than 0.3 (30 percent) different from surrounding horizontal surface.
The height of work surfaces should be in accordance with Clause 24.
Some ambulant people with disabilities prefer to work while seated on a stool. Consideration should therefore be given to this when determining bench height.
Where pull-out work surfaces are provided, e.g. as a set-down beside a stove, they should be fitted with handles and heat-resistant surfaces. A stop should be incorporated to ensure that shelves cannot accidentally be pulled right out.
At least one work surface should provide a clear width opening beneath the surface of not less than 820 mm to allow for a front approach by a wheelchair.
A5 SINKS For users in wheelchairs a shallow sink is essential, hence the preferred maximum bowl depth is 150 mm. The clearance underneath should comply with the requirements for washbasins in AS 1428.1 (see Figure A2).
The underside of the sink bowl, exposed pipes, taps and fittings should be insulated to avoid burns.
A6 WATER TAPS Taps should comply with Clause 23. The following is also recommended:
(a) For people with vision impairment, the cold water tap should be identified by having a two-pronged handle, with the hot water tap remaining a handle with four prongs (see Figure A3).
(b) Wherever practicable, tap washers operating on the principle of a ball valve in synthetic rubber washers, or ceramic or hydraseal types should be used because of the ease of turning on and off and their maintenance-free life and ease of replacement.
(c) For people with limited hand movement, lever action fittings should be used.

A7 OVENS Wall ovens should be installed so that the bottom shelf is on approximately the same level as the adjacent work surface. The drop-down type of oven door which does not slide away is not recommended as it limits reach for wheelchair users. Where a pull-out work surface is not provided, there should be a clear worktop at one side of the oven to allow for set down. If a side-hinged oven door is used, the clear worktop should be on the opposite side (see Figure A4).

Controls should be within the zone of common reach shown in Figure 23. They should be easy to operate by the intended user and clearly marked. For people with vision impairment, tactile indicators should be provided on all controls.
Ovens with a light and a timer are preferred.
A8 COOKTOPS Cooktops should be flush or as close to flush as possible with the adjacent benchtops and they should have adequate heat-resistant work surfaces.
Cooktops should have countertop controls. For people with vision impairment, tactile markings should be provided on all controls.
For people with vision impairment, gas stoves are preferred as they provide an instant heat that gives an immediate indicator that a burner is operational.
Gas burners should have automatic ignition.
If an electric hotplate is used, coil elements are preferred as they do not transmit as much heat as solid elements to the surrounding area.
Hotplates and burners should be positioned away from trafficable areas within the kitchen.
For general use by people with disabilities and older people, an electric cooking unit is preferred for reasons of safety, especially where there is a loss of sense of smell.
A9 REFRIGERATOR For small households, a refrigerator installed within the zone of common reach shown in Figure 23 is preferred.
A clear worktop space alongside a refrigerator is recommended for set-down. This should be on the side opposite to the hinge of the door.
A10 DISHWASHER The dishwasher will be best located close to the sink, and crockery and cutlery storage areas. Consideration should be given to raising the height of the dishwasher for use by ambulant people with disabilities.
NOTE: This might not always be possible as most dishwasher doors open down.
Worktop space should be provided on each side of the unit to allow for ease of loading and unloading.
A11 VENTILATION ­ RANGE HOOD A range hood with an external exhaust is preferred to a recirculating type which requires regular filter changes.
A12 WALL AND FLOOR FINISHES Floor surfaces should be easy to maintain and slip-resistant when wet or dry.
Floor coverings with coved skirtings are preferred (see Figure A5).

FIGURE A5 COVED SKIRTING
A13 LIGHTING AND POWER OUTLETS Switches and general purpose outlets should comply with Clause 23. Lighting should comply with Clause 19. Large rocker-type switches are preferred. If additional over-bench lighting is required, it should be recessed behind a pelmet. All switches should be within the zone of common reach (see Figure 23).

A14 LAUNDRY TUBS For users in wheelchairs, the height above floor level and the clearance underneath should be accordance with the requirements for washbasins in AS 1428.1. Shallow laundry tubs should be provided. Consideration may be given to installing a kitchen sink rather than a deep standard-sized laundry tub. Frontal approach to tubs is preferred. If it is not practical to provide knee access below laundry tubs, planning may allow for a parallel approach rather than a frontal approach. Taps should be in accordance with Paragraph A6.
A15 WASHING MACHINE AND DRYER Front-loading machines are preferred. It is desirable that fixed plumbing outlets are made for washing machines. Controls should be clearly marked and easy to operate by the intended user. Soft touch controls are preferred. Controls and taps for washers and dryers should be in the zone of common reach shown in Figure 23.
A16 SHELVES Adjustable shelving is best so that the space can be arranged to suit the individual. If shelving is used it should be within the common zone of reach shown in Figure 23.
A17 IRONING BOARD Portable boards are often unsteady and difficult to erect. A securely fixed, dropdown or hinged ironing board is recommended.
A18 CLOTHESLINE Where a clothesline is installed and may be used by people who are either standing or seated, it should be installed so that its operating height at its lowest is 1100 mm, and at its highest is 1600 mm from the ground surface. Access to the clothesline should be provided as part of the accessible path of travel within and to the building.
