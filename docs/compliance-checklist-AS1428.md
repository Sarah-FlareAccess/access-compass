**Key Access Features:**

People with disabilities will require appropriate numbers of accessible parking bays. These should be located as close as possible to the principal pedestrian entrance of the building with a continuous accessible path of travel from the parking area.

A bay is required to provide appropriate access for both the driver and passenger to load and unload mobility aids including wheelchairs and scooters, without putting users at risk of being injured by passing traffic. A user will often need to open the vehicle door fully to gain access to the vehicle. Some users may need access to a storage device on top of their vehicle so overhead clearance for ease of access is also important.

Other key access elements include provision of a level ground surface, appropriate signage and line marking, kerb ramps, lighting, overhead clearance, accessible type and location of parking payment mechanisms and tactile ground surface indicators as per relevant Australian Standards. Shelter where it can be provided assists all users in hot or wet conditions.

Signage located at the entrance to any car park in addition to the time limit and number of accessible spaces available assists users.

**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* and referenced Australian Standards**

* numbers of accessible parking bays are determined by the class and use of the building that they are provided for;  
* a level, firm ground surface is required;  
* vertical clearances of 2200mm are required to the designated accessible parking bay, with 2500mm required above the bay proper;  
* delineation of the accessible parking bay and shared area (angled bay) is to be with yellow lines and the dedicated space is to be provided with the international symbol of access with dimensions as set out in Australian Standards.

An angled parking bay specifically for use by people with disabilities. It is required to have:

* a dedicated space a width of 2400mm;  
* length 5400mm; and   
* with an adjoining shared pathway (at grade) a minimum width of 2400mm and length of 5400mm at the side; and   
* 2400mm long x 2400mm wide shared area at one end of the dedicated space i.e. entirely at the front or entirely at the rear of the dedicated space.

If a parallel bay is provided, it is required to have: 

* a dedicated space a minimum width of 3200mm;   
* length of 7800mm; and  
* with an adjoining shared 1600mm wide path of travel at the non-trafficable side. 

Access to the adjacent pathway shall be level or via a kerb ramp at the front or rear of the bay. 

Refer to AS 2890.5 for requirements for on-street parking for people with disabilities.

Existing accessible parking bays (within a car park associated with a building) are required to be upgraded to meet the requirements of AS 2890.6-2009 when a building changes use or the car park area is part of construction works subject to a building approval.

**Key Access Features**  
Both adults and children with disabilities will require access to Children’s Services Centres. Parents, grandparents, children or staff may have a variety of access needs and consideration should to be given to all of these.  
   
State and/or Commonwealth Children’s Services Centre Regulations detail specific requirements that must be met, in order for a facility to be registered to operate as a preschool or child care centre. 

Many of these regulations relate to the safety of children and are mandatory, e.g. child proof gate. Some of the regulations will create access barriers for some people, particularly people with mobility challenges. For example, the need for a childproof gate at the front entry of the centre to ensure children cannot get out onto the road is essential, however a person who uses a wheelchair, is of short stature or has dexterity issues, may have difficulty independently using the gate.

Alternatives such as intercoms or door bells as well as automated door openers should be provided. Staff support will sometimes be required and it is essential that staff are aware of the barriers that may prevent independent access.

Other key access issues include provision of accessible car parking, toilets for both children and adults, emergency assembly areas, access to and onto playground equipment, colour contrasts, acoustic materials to reduce noise and glare free lighting, particularly for babies who spend a lot of time on their backs looking up at light.  
**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* and referenced Australian Standards**  
An accessway (CAPT) is required to and into the area.

**Key Access Features**

The use of luminance, colour and textural contrasts within the built environment maximises accessibility for people with low vision who may have difficulty interpreting objects, fixtures, fittings, changes in surfaces and clear paths of travel. 

Luminance contrast is required in many locations and is preferred to colour contrast alone. Luminance contrast refers to the difference in the light / dark properties of two adjacent surfaces rather than just their colours. It is luminance contrast that is important to enhancing vision, because it offers light / dark differences that can be picked up more easily by people with low vision. For example, cherry red on black has a high colour contrast but low luminance contrast, and is not as visible as pale pink or yellow on black to people with low vision. 

The use of luminance and colour contrast is very helpful in assisting people with low vision to locate important aspects of the environment such as poles, bollards, furniture, doors and doorways (particularly glass doors), signs, handrails and other objects of interest. Contrast can also be used to highlight potential hazards such as the edges of steps, a roadway or poles in streetscapes and play areas. 

Textural contrast can also be helpful such as tactile markers that people can identify by feel. Tactile ground surface indicators commonly seen at the edges of railway platforms are a good example of this. Other examples include carpet matting on a vinyl floor surface and domed buttons on handrails to indicate the end of the stairway or ramp is approaching. 

**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* and referenced Australian Standards**

Luminance contrasts are required to meet Australian Standards:

* where Tactile Ground Surface Indicators (TGSIs) are installed – required levels of contrast vary from 30% to 60% dependant on the installation type;  
* at doorways (minimum width 50mm) – door and door jamb; door leaf and adjacent wall; architrave and wall; door leaf and architrave; or door jamb and adjacent wall;  
* to signage where required;  
* to a toilet seat within a unisex accessible toilet;  
* lighting is required to some signage to ensure it maintains its luminance contrast at night.


Warning Tactile Ground Surface Indicators are to be provided to warn a person with low vision that they are approaching:

* stairways (excluding fire isolated stairways);  
* an escalator;  
* a passenger conveyor or moving walk;  
* a ramp (excluding fire isolated ramps, a step ramps, a kerb ramp or a swimming pool ramp);  
* an overhead obstruction less than 2m (in the absence of a suitable barrier \-  other than a doorway);  
* level transitions between a vehicular way adjacent to a pedestrian entrance to a building.

An appropriate solid contrasting strip (min. 75mm with bottom edge at a height of 900 – 1000mm) is required to any frameless or fully glazed doorway and sidelights, or fully glazed wall that is capable of being mistaken as a door or entry (strip must be viewable from 2m either side.  This may require a difference between the internal and external strips).

A raised tactile warning is required at some handrail installations (e.g. aged care centres).

**Checklist**

If the following elements are incorporated into the building, is there a **clear contrast between the element and the background surface** and / or the surrounding area:

**Key Access Features**

Wide self opening doors with step free entry and a continuous accessible path of travel to any customer service counter are important considerations in any customer service area.

Installation of low height reception counters, incorporating adequate leg clearance is essential. If high counters are installed, many users with disabilities, particularly a person who may be seated, may not effectively be able to undertake a conversation with staff. They may in fact be excluded, whilst staff talk with a friend or carer who is standing at eye level.

Consideration should also be given to the provision of other furniture that allows a person using a wheelchair or an older adult ease of access. Tables with leg clearance underneath, circulation space around and between furniture and fittings, and colour contrast with background, dimensions and supports such as backs and armrests. D or D lever style handles on any cupboards assist all users. 

Other key access elements include provision of internal accessways free from any obstructions such as pot plants, seating or displays. Controls for doors, switches, power points, security alarm pads etc. should provide ease of use for a person using a wheelchair or with a manipulatory disability.

Pamphlets and brochures provided in accessible locations and at accessible heights for people of short stature or using a wheelchair.

Clear directional signage indicating the various service areas as well as hearing augmentation and consistent even lighting are also required. 

Appropriate hearing augmentation including Assistive Listening Systems and supports, should be available for people who are Deaf or hard of hearing. Inclusion of acoustic design elements in new or refurbished projects will assist in providing interior spaces that are responsive to the hearing needs of older persons, or people who are Deaf or hard of hearing. 

**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* and referenced Australian Standards**

An accessway (CAPT) is required to and through the area

Hearing augmentation to be provided:

* at any screened reception counter, ticket office, teller’s booth at which the public are separated.

**Key Access Features**

Principal pedestrian entrances shall provide wide, level, step free access for use by all people. These may include a level / flat transition or ramp from an adjoining path or walkway. An accessible entry should not incorporate any steps, stairs or turnstiles or other impediment that inhibits its independent use by a person with a disability or a person using a mobility aid such as a pram or delivery trolley. 

Automatic self opening / closing doors are preferred that incorporate motion and presence sensors, to ensure people do not get caught whilst the doors are operating and the use of automatic doors where the depth of the recess at the door is greater than 300mm will assist all users.

Other key access elements include provision of contrasting strips across any glass doors for ease of recognition, colour contrasts to frames, circulation spaces at entry points (inside and outside), alarm pads or card controls at an accessible height and clear concise signage indicating the entry and direction to facilities. 

Appropriate hearing augmentation including Assistive Listening Systems and supports, should also be available for people who are Deaf or hard of hearing at security points and intercoms.

**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* and referenced Australian Standards**

* access is required through the principal pedestrian entrance and not less than 50% of all pedestrian entrances (including the principal pedestrian entrance);  
* multiple doorway installation requirements vary;  
* a building \>500m² is required to provide an accessible entrance not more than 50m away from an inaccessible entrance;  
* a clear opening width of a min. 850mm at any doorway, including the active leaf of a multiple leaf door (except an automatic opening door) is required;  
* an appropriate solid contrasting strip (min. 75mm with bottom edge at a height of 900 – 1000mm) is required to any frameless or fully glazed doorway and sidelights, or fully glazed wall that is capable of being mistaken as a door or entry (strip must be viewable from 2m either side);

**AS 1428.5 \- 2010	 Communication for people who are deaf or hearing impaired**

**AS 1428.2 \- 1992	Design for access and mobility \- Enhanced and additional requirements – Buildings and facilities**

**Key Access Features**

Hearing augmentation is important for people who are Deaf or hard of hearing in order to support participation in a range of activities. Assistive listening systems are important in any area where people who are Deaf or hard of hearing wish to hear effectively, this may include areas where meetings, presentations, lectures, theatre, sporting and leisure events or similar activities are to be held. They should also be installed at customer service counters, teller’s cash booths and lifts.

A hearing augmentation system should always be provided in a space where a sound amplification system (e.g. speaker system) is installed. The area covered by the hearing augmentation system shall include appropriate signage for ease of identification by users.

Some assistive listening systems can be built into a facility, whilst others are portable and can be moved from room to room. 

Other considerations to assist a person who is Deaf or hard of hearing whilst using a building include, provision of acoustic design elements that assist in reducing background noise particularly in indoor areas such as reception counters, public meeting areas, social interchange points, information and cashier areas. These elements could include 

* rubber tips on furniture legs;  
* soft furnishings;  
* low pile carpet;  
* heavy curtains and wall hangings;  
* automatic doors closures;  
* double glazing on windows;  
* use of shrubs, trees or high, solid fences to limit traffic noise;  
* provision of quiet areas for conversations with users;  
* quiet air conditioners, fans and office equipment;  
* acoustic treatments to walls and ceilings.

Seating that provides good lines of sight to speakers, glare free surfaces to assist the audience with lip reading is also important, as well as adequate light for sign language interpreters to be seen easily.

Visible emergency alarms throughout the building, as well as at security checkpoints are also important.

**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* and referenced Australian Standards**

Hearing augmentation to be provided where an inbuilt amplification system is installed (other than one used only for emergency warning) 

* in a room in a class 9b building; or  
* at any ticket office, teller’s booth, reception area or the like, where the public is screened from the service provider; or  
* in meeting rooms, auditoriums, conference rooms and any room used for judicatory purposes in a class 9b building;  
* available between 80 – 95% of the space dependant on the system type;  
* signage is to be provided to inform users of availability of system and location of receivers if required;  
* any screen or scoreboard associated with a Class 9b building and capable of displaying public announcements must be capable of supplementing any public address system, other than a public address system used for emergency warning purposes only.

**AS / NZS 1428.4.1 \- 2009	Design for access and mobility – Tactile Indicators**

**Key Access Features**

Kerb ramps are necessary to provide an accessible transition between pathways or other features of the built environment, such as parking bays, to / from adjoining pathways, road crossing points or other uneven ground surfaces. Usually, each kerb ramp shall have an opposite kerb ramp, directly in line with the path of travel. This supports provision of an effective continuous accessible path of travel and ease of access particularly for a person using a wheelchair or other mobility aid. It also assists a person with low vision to find their way through an area more easily. 

Kerb ramps at road crossing points that lead users to steps or stairs only are not recommended.

Other key access features include provision of tactile ground surface indicators at kerb ramps as per Australian Standards, sloping sides on kerb ramps, alignment with adjacent medians, property boundaries or building lines, firm slip resistant surfaces, appropriate lighting.

**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 20*10 and referenced Australian Standards**

An accessway (CAPT) is required from the allotment boundary, car parking area (incorporating a designated accessible parking bay) and an adjoining accessible building (connected by a pedestrian link), which may incorporate the key access elements listed above.

**AS 1428.2 \- 1992		Design for access and mobility \- Enhanced and additional requirements – Buildings and facilities**

**Key Access Features**

Landscape designs, materials, plants, etc., should contribute to pedestrian safety. Avoid planting of species adjacent to pathways and car parking areas that develop overhanging foliage, and / or leaves / seeds that fall, as they can create difficulties for users.

Overflow of mulch, sap droppings, seed pods, berries, leaf and bark litter can create hazards for all users, particularly people with low vision or mobility impairments, especially in wet weather. Adequate overhead clearance shall be maintained above paved or occupied open areas.

Consideration should be given to plants that can assist users with way finding through an area. Plantings that provide orientation or direction cues for people with low vision, by incorporating distinctive scents, sounds, appearance or texture can be useful.

Dense plantings around passive rest areas can result in a feeling of isolation, particularly for younger children, older persons and people with disabilities and should be avoided. 

Lines of sight from seating to play areas for children should be available at all times. Landscaping should be appropriately maintained to ensure this is provided.

**AS 1428.5 \- 2010	Communication for people who are deaf or hearing impaired**

**AS 1735			Suite of Standards 	Lifts, escalators and moving walks**  

**Key Access Features**

Ideally, passenger lifts should be provided in all premises with more than one level (see APS / BCA for exemptions / limitations). They shall incorporate sufficient space to allow a person using a mobility aid, to comfortably enter and access the operational components including lift buttons with tactile elements and emergency intercoms etc. Handrails, tactile markings to lift buttons and signage shall also be provided. 

In some instances, particularly in retrofitting situations, it may be necessary to consider installation of platform lifts or stair climbers. These are not preferred in new facilities. 

Access to areas such as stages and swimming pools should incorporate appropriate ramp access.

Other key access features for lifts include auditory, tactile and visual considerations e.g. contrasts, glare free walls and controls, appropriate print size of controls and instructions.   Carpets that have a short pile length, appropriate door open dwell time to allow people to enter and exit safely, audio announcement of floor levels, and hearing augmentation to support communication for a person who are Deaf or hard of hearing in an emergency, must also be considered.

**Source – *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010***  
A floor dimension of 1400mm x 1600mm is required to a standard passenger lift (travelling over 12m). Requirements for other lifts vary dependant on the type of installation.  Refer to *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* for further detail.

A variety of features are required within the passenger lifts, these are specific to the type of installation provided. 

Lifts that travel over 2 floors require an audible announcement.

**NOTE:	Under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010*, the Access Code requires that a passenger lift have a floor dimension of not less than 1400mm x 1600mm (if travelling over 12m or 1100mm x 1400mm if travelling not more than 12m). This however, does not apply to a passenger lift that is in a new part or an affected part of an existing building if the lift travels more than 12m and has a lift floor that is not less than 1100mm x 1400mm.  Refer to *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* for further details.  For lifts that travel over 2 floors, an audible announcement is required.**

**Key Access Features**

A continuous accessible path of travel should be provided to and through any meeting area. Consideration should also be given to provision of appropriate seating which allows integrated wheelchair spaces and access at various locations within the area. Issues such as provision of seats with backrests and armrests, lines of sight for viewing and proximity to emergency exits and toilets are also important. 

Other key access features include provision of appropriate access to any stage or podium area, installation of hearing augmentation systems in any meeting spaces that seat 5 or more people, incorporating signage to indicate the space covered by the system and highlighting the edge of any stage or podium edge to assist identification, particularly for a person with low vision.

Consideration should be given to the provision of interpreters where required and appropriate lighting where interpreters are working. Computer, electronics and presentation equipment should be flexible enough to cater for a presenter who may have a disability.

**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* and referenced Australian Standards**

An accessway (CAPT) is required to and through the area.

Hearing augmentation to be provided where an inbuilt amplification system is installed (other than one used only for emergency warning) 

* in a room in a class 9b building; or  
* at any ticket office, teller’s booth, reception area or the like, where the public is screened from the service provider; or  
* in meeting rooms / auditoriums, conference rooms and any room used for judicatory purposes in a class 9b building;  
* available between 80 – 95% of the space dependant on the system type;  
* signage is to be provided to inform users of availability of system and location of receivers if required;

**Relevant References:**

* **Everyone Can Play Guidelines**

**Key Access Features**

Playgrounds should incorporate a continuous accessible path of travel from car parking to the playground area, and to and through all play components and facilities. This should be traversable by a person using a wheelchair and incorporate tactile cues for people with low vision. A variety of accessible play equipment should be provided to create opportunities for children with a range of disabilities to participate, rather than just watch play activities.

Incorporation of a range of play components that provide opportunities for ground and above ground play, sound and movement as well as tactile experiences are important. Seating with backrests and armrests, accessible toilets should also be considered as well as access to shade, shelter and drinking water.

Clear concise signage is also important and clear lines of sight from any seating to and over the play equipment is recommended to assist safety of children.

**AS / NZS 1428.4.1 \- 2009	Design for access and mobility – Tactile Indicators**

**Key Access Features:**

Ramps (or lifts) should be provided as an alternative to stairs, to ensure equity of access is provided for all building users. Ramps and landings shall incorporate appropriate widths, gradients, surfaces, handrails (both sides), tactile ground surface indicators (top and bottom), kerbs (both sides), vertical clearances, lighting, colour contrast edges and signage as required to Australian Standards.

Where a landing is provided at a doorway or with a change of direction, appropriate circulation space is required as detailed in Australian Standards. 

Depending on the location and the height of the rise several ramp types are available for use. These include threshold, step and kerb. 

**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* and referenced Australian Standards**

All ramps (excluding fire isolated and ramps in areas not required to be accessible) are to:

* provide an appropriate gradient (max. 1:14), kerbs, handrails, landings, surfaces, TGSIs, width, vertical clearances;  
* be set back from any transverse pathway (external boundary min. 900mm / internal corridor min. 400mm) to eliminate any protrusion into that pathway;  
* a series of connected ramps must not have a combined vertical rise of more than 3.6m;  
* step ramps can be used where the rise is no greater than 190mm.  They require an appropriate grade, length and appropriate side splay (where cross traffic) or barrier  
* a landing for a step ramp must not overlap a landing for another step ramp or ramp (in high pedestrian traffic areas)

**AS 1428.5 \- 2010		Communication for people who are deaf or hearing impaired**

**Key Access Features**

Provision of appropriate signage that is clear, concise, easy to read and displays the blue international symbol of access, as appropriate, to assist people with intellectual and cognitive and sensory issues is important. Other considerations include Braille and tactile markings, audio announcements, location, height and lighting of signs. The international symbol of access and the international symbol of deafness shall be displayed where relevant and meet the minimum Australian Standards requirements for style, colour and layout.

Signage should be located at any set down area, car park or on directional pathways to buildings, at any non accessible entrance directing users to the nearest accessible entrance, as well as at and inside building entrances. It should also be provided inside buildings to indicate accessible facilities and direction to various facilities. Signage shall be appropriately illuminated and incorporate font styles and sizes such as San Serif \- Univers, Arial or Helvetica. A combination of upper and lower case lettering (Title Case) shall be used for ease of interpretation.

Text alternatives to audio signage should be available and appropriate signage including the international symbol of deafness, should be used to identify the location and type of assistive listening system that is installed in any room or area of the building.

**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* and referenced Australian Standards**

Signage (including Braille and tactile) is to be provided:

* at any non-accessible building entrance providing appropriate direction to an accessible entrance;  
* at accessible toilets (including information about the facility configuration i.e. LH or RH);   
* at any non accessible bank of toilets directing a person to the accessible bank of toilets;  
* at ambulant toilet facilities;  
* at spaces incorporating hearing augmentation (including information about type of system in use and availability / location of receivers).

Braille and tactile signs must be illuminated (as required) to ensure luminance contrast requirements are met at all times during which the sign is required to be read.

Note: The BCA has additional requirements in relation to signage (egress).

# **23.0	Tactile Ground Surface Indicators** {#23.0-tactile-ground-surface-indicators}

**Relevant Australian Standards:**

**AS 1428.2 \- 1992		Design for access and mobility \- Enhanced and additional requirements – Buildings and facilities**

**AS / NZS 1428.4.1 \- 2009	Design for access and mobility – Tactile Indicators**

**Key Access Features**

Tactile Ground Surface Indicators (TGSIs) are specific tiles or materials with raised projections installed on the ground or floor surface to provide tactile information which can assist a person with low vision in orientation and way finding. 

Two types of TGSIs are currently used in Australia.

**Warning Indicators**: (raised domes) are used at intersections, mid block pedestrian crossings, other pedestrian / vehicle conflict areas and bus stops. They are also used where other hazards are present such as wharves or jetties, platform edges or prior to barriers on pathways such as signs or other obstructions, including overhead obstructions. They also inform people about changes in the direction of path of travel. 

**Directional Indicators:** (raised longitudinal strips) These assist people to negotiate difficult environments such as open or busy spaces, or to locate specific objects or locations such as bus stops, train platforms and other installations.

Directional and warning TGSIs are used on footpaths at intersections and mid block pedestrian crossings.

These should be installed so that people with low vision are able to locate the directional indicators leading towards the crossing point. There should be warning indicators prior to reaching the road surface at the kerb ramp or crossing point, including medians.

Directional and warning indicators are also used at bus stops for orientating pedestrians, including people who are blind or have low vision. Domed warning TGSIs are used to indicate the presence of any hazard, kerb edge or change of direction. 

Warning TGSIs are used in other areas where a hazard may be present. e.g. at pedestrian / vehicle conflicts where a driver may not be able to see pedestrians walking along a footpath or close to the edge of a jetty, wharf or train platform to alert a person with low vision to imminent danger. They may also be used at other locations where there may be an obstruction within a pathway such as a sign or other barrier.

Many people with low vision still retain some vision, so it is important that TGSIs are readily distinguishable by luminance contrast (can be achieved by tonal contrast within the same colour) and from adjacent surfaces. 

The consistent use and placement of TGSIs is a key consideration during installation, however TGSIs should not be overused. They are required when there are insufficient alternative or ‘natural’ tactile cues to warn of a hazard or change of direction.

TGSIs should also be installed where possible, so as to reduce interference with the manoeuvrability of wheelchairs or use of the area by other people with disabilities, including pedestrians with ambulatory disabilities.

**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* and referenced Australian Standards**

Tactile Ground Surface Indicators are to be provided to warn a person with low vision that they are approaching:

* stairways (excluding fire isolated stairways);  
* an escalator;  
* a passenger conveyor or moving walk;  
* a ramp (excluding fire isolated ramps);  
* an overhead obstruction less than 2m (in the absence of a suitable barrier) (other than a doorway);  
* level transitions between a vehicular way adjacent to a pedestrian entrance to a building.

Luminance contrasts are required to meet Australian Standards:

* where Tactile Ground Surface Indicators (TGSIs) are installed – this varies from 30% to 60% dependant on the installation type.

**Key Access Features**

Where sanitary facilities are provided accessible toilets and showers should also be provided. Unisex facilities are required as a male user may have a female carer or vice a versa. 

Signage including the international symbol of access as well as the term ‘Accessible Toilet’ is preferred to ‘Disabled Toilet’, as this indicates the facility is for use by anyone, including families. 

Baby change tables should only be installed in the toilet, if they do not encroach on the required circulation space for an accessible toilet, when left in the open or closed position. Some users with disabilities may not be able to place the change table back on the wall or move it out of the required circulation space when it is left open.

Compliance with relevant Australian Standards is crucial in accessible toilets, as many people with disabilities will not be able to use the facilities unless they are installed to minimum Standards. The most important consideration is the size of the area and the location of fittings to ensure that a person can easily move around and use the toilet and hand basin once inside. These Standards should be referred to prior to undertaking any works.

The BCA does not allow for provision of combined male/female ambulant toilets. The BCA requires separate male ambulant and separate female ambulant toilets.

**Note**: Toilets (2001 and 2021\)

Prior to the introduction of the Commonwealth *Disability (Access to Premises- Buildings Standards) 2010* (DAPS) the key reference for the dimensions of unisex accessible toilets (USAT), was Australian Standard 1428.1: 2001\. With the introduction of the Premises Standards and updates to referenced Australian Standards, AS 1428.1 2021 is now the primary reference for USATs.

However, the Premises Standards includes a concession for USATs in existing buildings, granted a building permit prior to 1st May 2011\. In practical terms, this concession means that if a USAT is part of a New Part in a building upgrade and the USAT meets the requirements of AS1428. 2001 they are not required to be upgraded to meet the requirements of AS 1428.1 2021\.

If however, the existing USAT does not meet the requirements of AS 1428.1 2001 then the USAT would need to be upgraded to meet the requirements of AS 1428.1 2021\.

**Requirements under the *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010* and referenced Australian Standards**

An accessible unisex sanitary compartment is required 

| Class of Building | Minimum accessible unisex sanitary compartments to be provided |
| :---- | :---- |
| Class 1b | not less than 1: and where private accessible unisex sanitary compartments are provided for an accessible bedroom, common accessible unisex sanitary compartments need not be provided |
| Class 2 | Where sanitary compartments are provided in common areas, not less than 1 |

| Class 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 – except for within a ward area of a Class 9a health care building | Where clause F2.3 of the BCA requires closet pans: 1 on every storey containing sanitary compartments; and Where a storey has more than 1 bank of sanitary compartments containing male and female sanitary compartments at not less than 50% of those banks |
| Class 10a – except A Class 10a appurtenant to another Class of building; and A sanitary compartment dedicated to a single caravan / camping site | At each bank of sanitary compartments containing male and female sanitary compartments, not less than 1 |

**Source – *Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards 2010***  
At each bank of toilets where there is one or more toilets in addition to a unisex accessible toilet, an ambulant toilet is to be provided. 

A unisex accessible toilet must not be located so that it can be entered without crossing an area reserved for one sex only.

A pan circulation space (min. 1900mm x 2300mm x 2000mm high) is required, with allowance for the appropriate fixtures and fittings to be provided within this space.

The requirement that an accessible sanitary compartment have the abovementioned pan circulation space does not apply to:

1) existing accessible sanitary compartments;   
2) existing sanitary compartments suitable for use by a person with a disability.

For the above section (a) or (b) to apply the accessible sanitary compartment must:

* comply with AS 1428.1—2001, *Design for access and mobility, Part 1: General requirements for access—New building work*; and   
* be located in either a new part, or an affected part, of a building*.*

# **25.0	Accessible Adult Change Facilities** {#25.0-accessible-adult-change-facilities}

**Relevant Legislation:**

**Disability (Access to Premises- Buildings) Standards 2010**

**National Construction Code 2022**

**Key Access Features**

An accessible adult change facility is intended to be used by people who cannot use standard accessible toilets. This may include people with an acquired brain injury, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, motor neurone disease and their carers, as well as many other people with a disability.

People need a toilet that contains an adult size adjustable changing table, a ceiling hoist, enough space (horizontally and vertically) and a safe and clean environment. Without these items, an accessible toilet that meets the Australian Standards for Access and Mobility is not functional. 

The Premises Standards requires Accessible Adult Change Facilities (AACF) to be installed in larger shopping centres and aquatic facilities, major sporting and recreational complexes, cultural facilities, and larger airports.  Although not formally required, accessible adult change facilities are also being installed in other venues such as premier train stations, hospitals, highway facilities, civic centres and other locations where operators such as councils believe they will be of benefit.

AACF also underpin the following National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) policy directions:

* Increased participation of people with disability, their families and carers in the social, cultural, recreational and sporting life of the community;  
* Improved accessibility of the built and natural environment through planning and regulatory systems, maximising the participation and inclusion of every member of the community;  
* A public, private and community transport system that is accessible for the whole community.

An AACF also enhances the carer’s physical wellbeing through removing the need to lift the person with a disability and through increased social opportunities and the removal of the everyday stress of planning around the bathroom needs of the person they are caring for.

An AACF is designed to accommodate two carers and a person (who may be using a wheelchair) who needs assistance to attend to their personal hygiene and toileting needs.

The ceiling hoist is designed to provide coverage of the whole room in order to facilitate ease of access to the toilet and to the change table.  The toilet pan must be of the “peninsula” type with movable handrails either side of the toilet bowl to allow a carer on each side to assist. Further requirements, such as those for door controls and signage, the need for a full round seat, secure fixings, load ratings, luminance contrast, flushing controls, and for the backrest and grabrails, aim in their entirety to address the range of disability and access challenges.  

Provision of two parallel changing rails, each at differing heights, are installed to provide a user with support when they are having their clothing adjusted.  Other requirements such as adjustable hot water at the basin \- controlled via a lever tap or sensor controls \- provision of a mirror and shelf, soap dispenser and clothes hook, and the need for operational instructions for the hoist and change table, also enhance the usability of the facility.

**Requirements as per the Premises Standards**

**F2.9 Accessible adult change facilities**

(1) *Accessible* adult change facilities required by subclause (2):  
(a) must be constructed in accordance with Part F3; and
